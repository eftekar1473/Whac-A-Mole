🎯 Whac-A-Mole: Mario Edition 🎯

A fun, interactive **Whac-A-Mole** desktop game built in **Java** using **Swing**!
Tap the mole (Monty) for points—but beware of the piranha plants! One wrong move and it's game over.

I built this game seeing a youtube video to learn how to bbuild a game using java and swing. I modified this game like you can click only one time before the mole(monty) move but there you can click multiple time also i added a function when your score reached 100 your game speed will increase 10ms  when 200 it will increase more 10ms. 

In future i intend to add more future.
